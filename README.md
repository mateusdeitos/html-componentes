# html-componentes
A proof-of-concept of a way to create components using jQuery

The idea consisted in creating functions as abstractions of html tags that extends the jQuery object.

By the time I created this idea we didn't use React yet at Tiny, but this idea never came to light because we thought that would be better to just use ReactJS instead of creating this abstraction on top of jQuery
